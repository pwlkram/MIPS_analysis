# MIPS_analysis
Analyses of MIPS experiment data

Done:
- data import, cleaning and transformations
- Time to any answer histogram
- Time to correct answer histogram
- N of correct answers in each test histograms
- N of correct answers by participant plots
- Total N of fixations boxplots (each test)
- N of fixations before ROI hit (ich_stroke and norm_pat tests)
- Total time of answer vs. N of correct answers scatterplots (each test and total)
- Statistical tests:
  - time to answer
  - time to correct answer
  - N of correct answers

TODO:
- Scatterplots:
  - FixToROI vs. Correct
  - NOfFix vs. Correct
  - TimeToROI vs. Correct
  - FixFreq vs. Correct
- Eye-tracking data statistical tests
